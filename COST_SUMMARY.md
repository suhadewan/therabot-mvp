## Cost Optimization Tips

### 1. Reduce OpenAI Costs (Save $20-40/month)

**Current Settings (Already Good):**
- Max tokens: 150 (keep short)
- Temperature: 0.7 (balanced)
- Model: Fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini (cheapest)

**Additional Savings:**
```python
# Cache common questions
common_responses = {
    "hi": "Hi! How are you feeling today?",
    "hello": "Hello! I'm here to listen. What's on your mind?",
    # ... more common greetings
}

# Save ~10-15% on OpenAI costs
```

**Set Budget Alerts:**
- Hard limit: $150/month
- Email alert: $100/month
- Daily check: $5/day threshold

### 2. Use Free Tiers (Save $30-50/month)

‚úÖ **Free Services:**
- Sentry: 5,000 errors/month
- Better Uptime: 3 monitors
- Cloudflare: CDN + SSL
- Supabase: 500MB database (for pilot)

### 3. Rate Limiting (Prevent Abuse)

**CRITICAL:** Without rate limiting, one user could cost $100-200/month!

```python
# Already implemented in rate_limiter.py
@rate_limit(max_requests=20, window_hours=1)
```

This prevents:
- API abuse
- Runaway costs
- System overload

**Savings:** Prevent $50-200+/month in abuse

## Warning Signs & Limits

### Set Alerts For:

**OpenAI Usage:**
- [ ] $3/day = On track
- [ ] $5/day = Warning
- [ ] $10/day = Alert team

**Error Rate:**
- [ ] <1% = Good
- [ ] 1-5% = Investigate
- [ ] >5% = Emergency

**Response Time:**
- [ ] <3s = Good
- [ ] 3-5s = Acceptable
- [ ] >5s = Slow, investigate

---

## Emergency Budget

If costs spike unexpectedly:

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Check OpenAI dashboard** - Unusual spike?
2. **Review rate limiting** - Someone abusing?
3. **Check error logs** - Retry loops?
4. **Reduce limits temporarily** - 20 ‚Üí 10 messages/hour

### Cost Reduction Tactics:
```python
# Temporarily reduce limits
MODEL_MAX_TOKENS = 100  # from 150
RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS = 10  # from 20

# Can reduce costs by 30-40%
```

---

## Payment & Billing

### Setup Billing Alerts

**OpenAI:**
1. Dashboard ‚Üí Billing
2. Set usage limit: $150/month
3. Email alerts: $25, $50, $100

**Render:**
1. Billing ‚Üí Usage alerts
2. Email at: $30, $50

**Credit Card:**
- Use business card
- Set $200/month limit
- Enable alerts

---

## Questions to Clarify

Before finalizing budget, clarify:

1. **"200 messages per hour per user"**
   - Is this really PER USER? 
   - Or 200 total messages per hour for all users?
   - HUGE cost difference!

2. **Expected usage pattern:**
   - How many users/day?
   - Average messages/user?
   - Peak times?

3. **Budget approval:**
   - Minimum: $80/month?
   - Recommended: $150/month?
   - Maximum: $300/month?
